# Mouse Look Lock (continued)

LUA WoW addon.

[Published on CurseForge |==>](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/)

### `Foreword`
Originally developed by TrimbleEpic.
I just integrated some community fixes and added more frames to the "MouseLook_FramesToCheck" list.
Don't forget to set your "MouseLook toggle" keybind (see screenshot).

### `Description`
Enables mouselook by holding right mouse button automatically, so the game plays more like an action RPG.
Mouselook turns off when AOE casting or when certain UI windows are open.
The addon does not provide a reticle (I use "FarmHud" addon for that).
I use modified "Cycle Arena" addon to scroll through party/raid members while mouselook is on.
(most, but not all of the situations are implemented, so manually turning the cursor on/off may be needed occasionally)
